# CMake Tutorial

In this repository I followed the [CMake tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html) and took notes about it.

## Introduction

The CMake tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers common build system issues that CMake helps address. Seeing how various topics all work together in an example project can be very helpful.

All this was done in order to be able to use CMake in further more complex projects.

The Tutorial consists of 11 steps, each one contained in its corresponding folder.

## Notes

While doing the Tutorial, I took notes which are available as a "Cheat Sheet" in [the notes file](NOTES.md)
