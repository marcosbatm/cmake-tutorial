# CMake Tutorial

In this repository I followed the [CMake tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html) and took notes about it.

## Introduction

The CMake tutorial provides a step-by-step guide that covers common build system issues that CMake helps address. Seeing how various topics all work together in an example project can be very helpful.

All this was done in order to be able to use CMake in further more complex projects.

The Tutorial consists of 11 steps, each one contained in its corresponding folder.

## Notes

While doing the Tutorial, I took notes which are available as a "Cheat Sheet" in [the notes file](NOTES.md)

## Other Resources

While doing the Tutorial, I used what I learned to develop other complex projects. This lead to situations where multiple solutions to the same problem were available, but only some of them followed modern CMake standards which try to focus on avoiding scaling problems and simplifying the CMake experience.

A very useful resource to this matter is [Modern Cmake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/README.html) by [Henry Schreiner](https://iscinumpy.gitlab.io/).

**Note:** most of the AI-generated CMake code doesn't follow modern standards, I found out. If you decide to use LLMs to generate this type of code for your projects, I encourage you to proceed with precaution.
